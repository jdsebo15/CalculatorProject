# CalculatorProject

This is a calculator that I built for the odin project. This project really taught me functions and i used it to learn arrow functions as well since the normal function syntax was familiar to me from my work in C. 

I found this work PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING. Mostly due to the multitude of edge cases. At some point I decided to stop and move on through the course. My previous experience has taught me that sometimes a 90% correct solution is best and that it is better to ship a mostly functional product and to work out the bugs as you go. With that being said there is a list of problems that I will eventually address in this problem.
